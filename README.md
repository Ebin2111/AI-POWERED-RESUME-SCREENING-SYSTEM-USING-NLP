# AI-POWERED-RESUME-SCREENING-SYSTEM-USING-NLP
Developed an AI-powered resume screening system using NLP to analyze resumes against job descriptions. The system preprocesses unstructured text, extracts skills, and applies ML-based similarity scoring to rank candidates, improving hiring efficiency and reducing manual screening effort.

**Key Features**

*Automated extraction and preprocessing of unstructured resume text

*Skill and keyword extraction using NLP techniques

*Resume-to-job description matching using vector embeddings

*Candidate ranking based on cosine similarity scores

*Visualization of top-ranked candidates for easy interpretation

**Methodology**

The system preprocesses resumes by cleaning and normalizing text data, followed by feature representation using NLP embeddings. Similarity scoring is applied between resumes and job descriptions to quantify relevance. Candidates are then ranked based on similarity scores, enabling data-driven and unbiased shortlisting.

**Tech Stack**

*Programming Language: Python
*Libraries & Tools: NLP, Machine Learning, Cosine Similarity
*Data Processing: Text preprocessing and feature extraction
*Visualization: Matplotlib

**Output**
The final output includes a ranked list of candidates along with similarity scores and visual charts highlighting the top-matching resumes for a given job role.



**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the practical application of NLP and machine learning in solving real-world recruitment challenges. By automating resume screening and ranking, the system ensures faster, scalable, and more objective hiring decisions.
